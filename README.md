Deep dive into Python:master one programming language :punch:

#### Goal
I have experiences in multiple programming languages includeing Java, JavaScript, PHP and Python. But I've never gone through perfect run through in any of the language.

This repository serves as my study material. I aim to collect a thorough knowledge about programming language by running through a comprehensive book in Python. 

My goal is to strengthen my foundational knowledge in how a programming language is built, hopefully grabbing a macro view over programming language architecture.

#### Reference Book
* **Learning Python** : By *Mark Lutz*

#### Mechanism
* Directories will be arranged by chapters of the book.

* Summaries / sample codes will be assorted as a markdown file.

* Summaries might exclude portions that I already know / I consider I can fill up later. Please note that this will be a very subjective assortment.
